# Harmonies Through Time: Orlando Gibbons 400th Anniversary Game

A HTML5 game celebrating the 400th anniversary of Orlando Gibbons (1583-1625), renowned English composer and organist of the late Renaissance/early Baroque period.

## Game Concept
"Harmonies Through Time" takes players on a journey through key moments in Orlando Gibbons' life and career.
